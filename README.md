# libebpf-offload

This is a library for offloading eBPF programs to external devices. For example, check the [ebpf-test](https://github.com/iomartin/ebpf-test) utility, or the [ebpf_offload](https://github.com/iomartin/ebpf_offload) project.

Note that this is still in alpha stage and we make no guarantee of API stability.
